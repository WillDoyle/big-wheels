        Soft-rock sweethearts Big Wheels are catapulting their ethereal blend of
        modern-day confessional songwriting and colourful retro allure into 2023
        without hesitation.
        <br />
        The release of their first two singles ‘Chain of Fire’ and ‘All I Ever
        Wanna Do’ has sent the Sydney-based four-piece onto a trail of both
        national and international recognition. Collectively the tracks have
        made airwaves on BBC Music Introducing, Triple J Unearthed, US College
        Radio, Double J, FBi Radio, 3RRR and Boogaloo Radio in the UK. “ a
        catchy as heck love song with big timeless appeal “ Declan Byrne (Triple
        J) review of ‘All I Ever Wanna Do’. August 2022 The undeniable
        songwriting connection between co-captains Cass Ford & Lawson Doyle
        exemplifies their combining and different perspectives on romance, ego,
        life and individuality, taking you down a rabbit hole of comforting
        relatability. Between a unique cosmic blend of classic rock & roll,
        blues and country, together they draw heavy inspiration from the likes
        of Fleetwood Mac, Oasis, Neil Young & Jefferson Airplane. Winding back
        to the beginnings of Big Wheels, these three effervescent wildcards
        entered into each other's bubbles with nothing less than perfect timing.
        Having crossed paths fatefully back in 2016, the fire was lit out of
        Doyle and Ford’s mutual love and respect for one another’s vivacity and
        style. Doyle had spent the past 5 years of his career performing across
        festival stages and selling out rooms with two respective outfits
        Sunflower & Port Royal while Ford, no stranger to a life on the road,
        had spent her childhood years touring Australia with a mother and father
        both in the music biz. Drummer Dale Coombes made his timely entrance via
        a mutual friend after years of holding only a degree of separation from
        the pair. “ Singer Cass Ford has the kind of velvet vocals that entice
        and mesmerise - a touch of Stevie Nicks - that are embellished by the
        delicate harmonies “ Arun Kendall (Backseat Mafia) on ‘Chain of Fire’.
        May 2022 In a whirlwind of uncertain times late 2021, the trio leapt
        into their early creative experimentation, while taking up residence in
        a sleepy suburb on the Sunshine Coast, QLD. It was here, they came to
        the conclusion that a move to the big smoke of Sydney was inevitably on
        the horizon. Since then, the band has landed support slots with
        heavy-hitters San Cisco, Pacific Avenue, Jack Botts, DICE and Rum Jungle
        along with a string of successful festival appearances up and down the
        east coast. In September 2022, Big Wheels debuted a live studio
        performance of Chain of Fire on ABC TV’s latest talk show Frankly with
        Fran Kelly. The brand continues on a steady trajectory which has so far
        lead to a number of notable collaborations including a recent clothing
        sponsorship from Wrangler Australia. With their newest soft-rock swinger
        ‘Colourblind’ due early February 2023, Big Wheels are gearing up for a
        huge year of new milestones as they release their ever-growing eclectic
        and vibrant catalogue.
